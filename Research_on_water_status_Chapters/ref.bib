All measurements were realized with 10\% KOH and 10\% NaOH solutions and the results were compared and evaluated.

In the presented paper, the visualization platform of the single fuel cell and the water balance model were built to investigate the water transport mechanisms. A transparent 25 cm2 single fuel cell with serpentine flow channels was adopted. Based on the experimental data, firstly, the change rate of water content in the fuel cell was calculated quantitatively and the reliability of the water balance model was rigorously validated. Then, the water state in the fuel cell as the qualitative finding was observed online to assist the research of water transport mechanisms. Finally, the effects of inlet gas temperature, inlet gas humidity, and hydrogen/air stoichiometry on the EIS, the voltage, and the water content in the fuel cell were studied quantitatively, respectively. The corresponding relationship between the performance and the water content in the fuel cell was obtained.},

  abstract = {Alkaline fuel cells are low temperature fuel cells for which stationary applications, like cogeneration in buildings, are a promising market. To guarantee a long life, water and thermal management has to be controlled in a careful way. To understand the water, alkali and thermal flows, a model for an alkaline fuel cell module is developed using a control volume approach. Special attention is given to the physical flow of hydrogen, water and air in the system and the diffusion laws are used to gain insight in the water management. The model is validated on the prediction of the electrical performance and thermal behaviour. The positive impact of temperature on fuel cell performance is shown. New in this model is the inclusion of the water management, for which an extra validation is performed. The model shows that a minimum temperature has to be reached to maintain the electrolyte concentration. Increasing temperature for better performance without reducing the electrolyte concentration is possible with humidified hot air.},

  abstract = {At present, despite the great advances in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology over the past two decades through intensive research and development activities, their large-scale commercialization is still hampered by their higher materials cost and lower reliability and durability. In this review, water management is given special consideration. Water management is of vital importance to achieve maximum performance and durability from PEMFCs. On the one hand, to maintain good proton conductivity, the relative humidity of inlet gases is typically held at a large value to ensure that the membrane remains fully hydrated. On the other hand, the pores of the catalyst layer (CL) and the gas diffusion layer (GDL) are frequently flooded by excessive liquid water, resulting in a higher mass transport resistance. Thus, a subtle equilibrium has to be maintained between membrane drying and liquid water flooding to prevent fuel cell degradation and guarantee a high performance level, which is the essential problem of water management. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art studies of water management, including the experimental methods and modeling and simulation for the characterization of water management and the water management strategies. As one important aspect of water management, water flooding has been extensively studied during the last two decades. Herein, the causes, detection, effects on cell performance and mitigation strategies of water flooding are overviewed in detail. In the end of the paper the emphasis is given to: (i) the delicate equilibrium of membrane drying vs. water flooding in water management; (ii) determining which phenomenon is principally responsible for the deterioration of the PEMFC performance, the flooding of the porous electrode or the gas channels in the bipolar plate, and (iii) what measures should be taken to prevent water flooding from happening in PEMFCs.},

  abstract = {In this work, a fundamental cathode catalyst degradation model is developed in order to simulate fuel cell stack durability under realistic vehicle operation. A dynamic platinum degradation model featuring platinum dissolution and redeposition is developed to account for the Ostwald ripening phenomenon. The model is then calibrated for a variety of accelerated stress test data with different upper and lower potential limits and temperatures. Next, a case study of fuel cell transit bus operation in the city of Victoria, B.C., Canada is carried out to investigate the effects of stack size and temperature on the cathode catalyst durability. To this end, the required power density and cell voltage are calculated from the drive cycle considering vehicle dynamics and specifications. Larger stacks are found to experience higher upper potential limits; thus, showing lower lifetimes. The cathode lifetime is predicted to grow 379\% at 80°C if the stack nominal power is lowered from 396 to 132~kW while the performance requirement is met. The temperature is also shown to have a tremendous impact on the cathode lifetime. A temperature drop from 80 to 60°C results in 154\% cathode lifetime enhancement for a stack nominal power of 264~kW.},

Various combinations of cells were built and tested with {PTLs} at the electrodes using either carbon fibre paper with a {MPL} ({SGL} 10BB) or carbon fibre paper without a {MPL} ({SGL} 10BA). The net water drag coefficient at three current densities (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7Acm−2) for two combinations of anode/cathode relative humidity (60/100\% and 100/60\%) and stoichiometric ratios of H2/air (1.4/3 and 1.4/2) was determined from water balance measurements. The addition of a {MPL} to the carbon fibre paper {PTL} at the cathode did not cause a statistically significant change to the overall drag coefficient although there was a significant improvement to the fuel cell performance and durability when a {MPL} was used at the cathode. The presence of a {MPL} on either electrode or on both electrodes also exhibited similar performance compared to when the {MPL} was placed at the cathode. These results indicate that the presence of {MPL} indeed improves the cell performance although it does not affect the net water drag coefficient. The correlation between cell performance and global water transport cannot be ascertained and warrants further experimental investigation.},

The cyclic voltammetry ({CV}) and high frequency resistance ({HFR}) are introduced to character electrochemical active surface area ({ECSA}) of the electrode and water content in the cell. Under normal condition, it is found that {ECSA} decreases with the decrement of membrane water content and a critical point of water content exists for the {ECSA} sharp decrement. Under cold start operation, low initial water content aggravates the voltage drop when the load is applied. The high initial water content leads to a rapid membrane water saturation, causing a short shutdown time, while the low initial water content may lead to a bad cold start performance. For the excessive low initial water content, the voltage reversal due to water electrolysis and carbon corrosion is also considered. Besides, the {HFR} is also recorded during cold start operation to estimate ice formation in the cell. It is indicated that a proper initial membrane water content after purge is significantly vital for {PEM} fuel cell cold start to achieve the balance of {ECSA} and ice storage capacity.},

              Proton exchange membrane fuel cells, consuming hydrogen and oxygen to generate clean electricity and water, suffer acute liquid water challenges. Accurate liquid water modelling is inherently challenging due to the multi-phase, multi-component, reactive dynamics within multi-scale, multi-layered porous media. In addition, currently inadequate imaging and modelling capabilities are limiting simulations to small areas ({\textless}1 mm
              2
              ) or simplified architectures. Herein, an advancement in water modelling is achieved using X-ray micro-computed tomography, deep learned super-resolution, multi-label segmentation, and direct multi-phase simulation. The resulting image is the most resolved domain (16 mm
              2
              with 700 nm voxel resolution) and the largest direct multi-phase flow simulation of a fuel cell.

The heat transfer numerical model of the system was established, and experimental data validated the feasibility of the model. Additionally, the thermal performance of the onboard fuel cell waste heat utilization system was analyzed under various operational conditions. The results indicate that the air temperature and heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger are positively correlated with the thermal performance of the cockpit heating, while the radiator inlet air velocity and pump speed show a negative correlation with the system’s performance. Under other steady conditions, the stabilized temperature of the cockpit is increased by 150 \% when the air temperature increases from 0 °C to 40 °C, and the cockpit temperature is reduced by 20 \% when the water pump speed accelerates from 100 to 300 r/min. Furthermore, under 20 °C ambient temperatures and with an inlet air velocity of 3 m/s, water pump speed of 500 r/min, and a heat exchange coefficient of 5,000 W·m−2·K−1, the fuel cell waste heat utilization system achieves an optimal waste heat utilization efficiency of 50.8 \% underrated working conditions.

However, the problems of insufficient reliability and durability have severely restricted their industrialization process. To improve the safety, reliability and durability of fuel cell system, a fault diagnosis method that combined kernel principal component analysis ({KPCA}) with an improved sparrow search algorithm ({ISSA}) and an optimized kernel extreme learning machine ({KELM}) was proposed in this study. Firstly, {KPCA} is utilized to extract nonlinear features from fault indicators and obtain the fault feature vector of the fuel cell system. Then, by incorporating logistic mapping and Cauchy Gaussian mutation strategies to improve the Sparrow Search Algorithm ({SSA}), {ISSA} was used to optimize the kernel parameters and regularization coefficient in {KELM}. The experimental results show that the {KPCA}-{ISSA}-{KELM} method for normal conditions, hydrogen leakage and membrane drying are 100\%, 98.5\% and 100\%, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 99.5\% and an operation time of 0.97s. The diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method is 10.4\%, 5.7\%, 4.8\%, 4.2\%, 3.0\%, 1.8\% higher than support vector machine ({SVM}), back propagation neural network ({BPNN}), {KELM}, genetic algorithm-based {KELM} ({GA}-{KELM}), particle swarm optimization-based {KELM} ({PSO}-{KELM}) and {SSA}-{KELM}, respectively, and the operation time is only slightly higher than that of the {SVM} model and {KELM} model.},
