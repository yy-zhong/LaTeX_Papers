All measurements were realized with 10\% KOH and 10\% NaOH solutions and the results were compared and evaluated. KOH solution is considered as a best available one because of its high chemical stability and efficiency of HHO gas production and NaOH solution was selected due to its low price and good availability.},

In the presented paper, the visualization platform of the single fuel cell and the water balance model were built to investigate the water transport mechanisms. A transparent 25 cm2 single fuel cell with serpentine flow channels was adopted. Based on the experimental data, firstly, the change rate of water content in the fuel cell was calculated quantitatively and the reliability of the water balance model was rigorously validated. Then, the water state in the fuel cell as the qualitative finding was observed online to assist the research of water transport mechanisms. Finally, the effects of inlet gas temperature, inlet gas humidity, and hydrogen/air stoichiometry on the EIS, the voltage, and the water content in the fuel cell were studied quantitatively, respectively. The corresponding relationship between the performance and the water content in the fuel cell was obtained.},

  abstract = {Alkaline fuel cells are low temperature fuel cells for which stationary applications, like cogeneration in buildings, are a promising market. To guarantee a long life, water and thermal management has to be controlled in a careful way. To understand the water, alkali and thermal flows, a model for an alkaline fuel cell module is developed using a control volume approach. Special attention is given to the physical flow of hydrogen, water and air in the system and the diffusion laws are used to gain insight in the water management. The model is validated on the prediction of the electrical performance and thermal behaviour. The positive impact of temperature on fuel cell performance is shown. New in this model is the inclusion of the water management, for which an extra validation is performed. The model shows that a minimum temperature has to be reached to maintain the electrolyte concentration. Increasing temperature for better performance without reducing the electrolyte concentration is possible with humidified hot air.},
