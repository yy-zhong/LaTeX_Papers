\subsection{Particle filter algorithm}

The specific steps of the particle filter algorithm are as Fig 2. Steps three, four, and five are repeated to achieve recursion.

The triggering methods of resampling are divided into periodic triggering and threshold triggering. Threshold triggering refers to triggering resampling when the ratio of the effective particle number to the total particle number is lower than the set threshold. The number of effective particles can be approximated as:

\begin{equation}
