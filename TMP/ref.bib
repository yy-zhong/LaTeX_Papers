  abstract = {Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) systems operating on carbonaceous fuels require water for fuel processing. Such systems can find wider applications if they do not require a supply of water in addition to the supply of fuel, that is, if they can be self-sustaining based on the water produced at the fuel cell stack. This paper considers a generic PEFC system and identifies the parameters that affect, and the extent of their contribution to, the net water balance in the system. These parameters include the steam-to-carbon and the oxygen-to-carbon ratios in the fuel processor, the electrochemical fuel and oxygen utilizations in the fuel cell stack, the ambient pressure and temperature, and the composition of the fuel used. The analysis shows that the amount of water lost from the system as water vapor in the exhaust is very sensitive to the system pressure and ambient temperature, while the amount of water produced in the system is a function of the composition of the fuel. Fuels with a high H/C (hydrogen to carbon atomic ratio) allow the system to be operated as a net water producer under a wider range of operating conditions.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.},

Our best model outperforms previous open-source multilingual code generation models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) in both left-to-right generation and infilling on the Java, JavaScript, and Python portions of MultiPL-E, despite being a substantially smaller model.

  abstract = {Excessive water formation inside the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell’s structures leads to the flooding of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) and cathode gas flow channels. This results in a negative impact on water management and the overall cell performance.   Liquid water generated in the cathode catalyst layer and the water moved from anode to cathode side due to electro-osmotic drag transport through the GDL to reach the gas flow field channels, where it is removed by air cathode gas stream. Due to high and uniform capillary force distribution effect of the pores through the GDL plane and surface tension between the water droplets and gas flow field channels surfaces, liquid water tends to block/fill the pores of the GDL and stick to the surface of the GDL and gas flow channels. Therefore, it is difficult to remove the trapped water in GDL structure which can lead to flood of the PEM fuel cell. The GDL surfaces are commonly treated uniformly with a hydrophobic material in order to overcome the flooding phenomena inside PEM fuel cell. Despite the importance impact of the surface wettability of both channel and GDL surface characteristics especially for the cathode side on the water management, few experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the two-phase flow in cathode gas flow channel and their crucial role. The work presented in this thesis covers contributions that provide insight, not only into the investigation of the effects of hydrophobic cathode GDL and cathode gas flow channels, on water removal, two phase flow inside the channel, and on PEM fuel cell performance, but also the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic GDLs and gas flow channels effects. Further, the effects of a novel GDL designs with sandwich and gradient wettability with driving capillary force through GDL plane have been investigated. Two-phase flow especially in the cathode gas flow field channels of PEM fuel cell has a crucial role on water removal. Hence, in this research, ex-situ investigations of the effects of channels with different surface wettability; superhydrophobic, hydrophobic, slightly hydrophobic, and superhydrophilic on the two-phase flow characteristics have been tested and visualized at room temperature. Pressure drop measurements and two-phase flow visualization have been carried out using high speed camera. The effect of the various coating materials on graphite and GDL surface morphology, roughness, static contact angle (θ), and sliding contact angle (α) have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Profilometry, and sessile drop technique, respectively. It has been observed that the two-phase flow resistance is considerably affected by surface wettability of the channels. Further, the overall cell performance can be improved by superhydrophobic gas flow channels mainly at high current density over slightly hydrophobic and superhydrophilic cases tested. In addition, sandwich wettability GDL has been coated with a silica particle/ Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. The porometric characteristics have been studied using, method of standard porosimetry (MSP). It has been found that sandwich wettability GDL has superhydrophobic surfaces with (θ = 162±2°), (α = 5±1°), and the internal pores are hydrophilic, while the mean pore radius is 7.1μm. This shows a low resistance to gas transport. On the other hand, performance testing indicates that (PEM) fuel cell equipped with sandwich wettability GDL results in the best performance compared to those with raw (non-coated) (slightly hydrophobic), PTFE coated (commercial with micro-porous layer (MPL)) (superhydrophobic), and silica coated (superhydrophilic) GDL. The wettability gradient has been introduced through plane of the one side hydrophobic GDL by coating one side of non-coated GDL with 15 wt. \% of PTFE solution; however, the other side remains uncoated. The effects of wettability gradient on the water removal rate, droplet dynamics, and PEM fuel cell performance have been covered in this thesis. Water removal rate is determined using a 20 ml syringe barrel, wherein a 13 mm diameter GDL token is fixed on the barrel opening. The droplets penetrating through the GDL are visualized via a high speed camera to study the droplets’ dynamic characteristics. The GDL wettability gradient has a significant impact on water removal rate, droplets’ dynamic characteristics, and consequently enhances the overall PEM fuel cell performance.},

  abstract = {The wake of the Paris Agreement set as a global imperative the pursuit of carbon neutrality. To achieve it, green hydrogen will play a central role, serving as an energy carrier generated from the abundant renewable energies, that can be converted into other sustainable energy carriers, such as methanol, ammonia, and hydrocarbon fuels. Even though renewable electricity is already very competitive and, in some cases, cheaper than its fossil-fuel counterpart, green hydrogen is presently still much more expensive than grey hydrogen, creating an econom­ ical impasse in the decarbonization pathway. During electrolysis, that is used to produce hydrogen from water and electricity, molecular oxygen, a byproduct, is also produced and often discarded. However, O2 is a needed feedstock in several industries, already playing an important role in co-combustion, oxidation treatments and medical applications. In this work we show how the utilization of this O2 can help green hydrogen projects to reach economic viability by proposing a new liquefaction process, simulated with the Aspen Plus® software, for high purity electrolytic O2. Depending on the scale, for green hydrogen projects in the range of 50–500 MW, a levelized cost of liquid O2 of 0.040–0.059 €/kgLO2 was obtained, competitive with the standard methods of O2 production such as cryogenic air separation and pressure swing adsorption. Considering a conservative liquid O2 selling price of 0.12 €/kgLO2, the return on investment per year for such liquefaction unit can vary between 10\% for 50 MW projects and 19–20\% for 250–500 MW. The returns obtained this way can be used to self-subsidize their own H2 production reducing the cost between 0.49 and 0.64 €/kgH2, respectively. The economic dynam­ ization of electrolytic O2 through liquefaction, transforms a byproduct into a marketable commodity, which not only provides an additional revenue stream but also aligns with the broader goal of sustainable resource utili­ zation and circular economy.},

  abstract = {A highly reliable experimental system that consistently closed the overall water balance to within 5\% was developed to study the role of a microporous layer (MPL), attached to carbon paper porous transport layer (PTL), on the water transport and performance of a standard 100cm2 active area PEM fuel cell. Various combinations of cells were built and tested with PTLs at the electrodes using either carbon fibre paper with a MPL (SGL 10BB) or carbon fibre paper without a MPL (SGL 10BA). The net water drag coefficient at three current densities (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7Acm−2) for two combinations of anode/cathode relative humidity (60/100\% and 100/60\%) and stoichiometric ratios of H2/air (1.4/3 and 1.4/2) was determined from water balance measurements. The addition of a MPL to the carbon fibre paper PTL at the cathode did not cause a statistically significant change to the overall drag coefficient although there was a significant improvement to the fuel cell performance and durability when a MPL was used at the cathode. The presence of a MPL on either electrode or on both electrodes also exhibited similar performance compared to when the MPL was placed at the cathode. These results indicate that the presence of MPL indeed improves the cell performance although it does not affect the net water drag coefficient. The correlation between cell performance and global water transport cannot be ascertained and warrants further experimental investigation.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen as a fuel of the future for mobile applications has the potential to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions significantly (Groos et al., 2023 [1]). A main focus to enable hydrogen powered aviation is the efficient storage onboard (Prewitz et al., 2023 [2]; Verstraete et al., 2010 [3]; Prewitz et al., 2020 [4]). Especially the storage volume is a major challenge because of the rather low volumetric energy density of compressed or either liquified hydrogen in comparison with kerosene (Hassan et al., 2021 [5]; Stetson et al., 2014 [6]; Troeltsch et al., 2020 [7]). Glass capillaries have a high strength, also their geometry and low hydrogen permeability make them a suitable micro pressure tank (Prewitz et al., 2018; Veziroglu et al., 2003 [8]; Meyer-Scherf, 2015 [9]). By combining glass capillaries and carbon fibers in a polymer matrix, a material composite could be developed that is both a structural element, contributing to load bearing, and a hydrogen tank at the same time. The synergetic use of the structure as storage could be a solution to tackle the problem of the increased required storage volume for hydrogen powered aviation. This paper presents a theoretical micromechanical analysis, the design and manufacturing process of the composite material, and the experimental results of tensile testing conducted on a glass capillary hybridized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (GCRP). The aim is to determine the influence of the glass capillary content on the tensile strength and tensile modulus of the GCRP.},

  abstract = {A novel method for the ad hoc and real-time determination of the water balance in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell is presented. The method requires the anode side of the fuel cell to be operated in open-ended mode and to use dry, pure hydrogen as is typical for vehicular applications. In that case there is a linear relationship between the anode outlet velocity and the effective drag coefficient of water through the membrane, rd, provided the stoichiometric flow ratio is sufficiently low (below ξ~=~1.2). The anode outlet velocity can then be directly measured e.g. by using hot wire anemometry, and this method provides a voltage signal that can be fed to the board computer of a fuel cell vehicle for PEMFC diagnosis. It is also shown that the nitrogen cross-over from cathode to anode has only a small effect on the anode outlet velocity. In addition to detecting the velocity, the relative humidity may be measured which is shown to be independent of the current density, but measurement techniques suffer from lower accuracy. It is argued that this method can also be applied to quantify fuel cell degradation. Finally, it is fundamentally shown that when operating the fuel cell in steady state mode at a hydrogen stoichiometric flow ratio as low as 1.03, the molar fraction of hydrogen in the gas mixture at the anode outlet is at least 50\% which means that at steady state there will be no hydrogen starvation at the anode outlet.},

  abstract = {A previously published computational multi-phase model of a polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cell cathode has been extended in order to account for the anode side and the electrolyte membrane. The model has been applied to study the water balance of a fuel cell during operation under various humidification conditions. It was found that the specific surface area of the electrolyte in the catalyst layers close to the membrane is of critical importance for the overall water balance. Applying a high specific electrolyte surface area close to the membrane (a water-uptake layer) can prevent drying out of the anode and flooding at the cathode while the average membrane water content is only weakly affected. The results also indicate that in contrast to common presumption membrane dehydration may occur at either anode or cathode side, entirely depending on the direction of the net water transport because the predominant transport mechanism is diffusion. Consequently, operating conditions with a high net water transport from anode to cathode should be avoided as it is important to keep the cathode catalyst layer well humidified in order to prevent high protonic losses. Addition of the micro-porous layer did not affect the overall water balance or membrane water content in our study.},

The model treats the catalyst layers in an interface approximation and the gas diffusion layers as linear transmission lines of water fluxes. It relates current density, pressure distribution, and water fluxes in the different functional layers of the assembly. The optimal mode of operation of UTCLs is in a fully flooded state. The main challenge for MEAs with UTCLs is efficient liquid water removal, to avoid flooding of the gas diffusion layers. The model provides strategies for increasing the critical current density for the onset of flooding, via liquid permeabilities, vaporization areas, and gas pressure differentials. Finally, we discuss methods to identify regimes of transport via water flux measurements.},

  abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are considered the most efficient technology for the direct conversion of hydro­ carbons to electrical energy. Although the commonly used Ni/YSZ cermet materials in SOFCs show excellent electrocatalytic properties in H2 fuel, they suffer from carbon deposition problem when hydrocarbon fuels are used. In this work, we study the use of Ni0⋅05Ru0.05-Mo2C with a porous nanorod-shaped morphology as an in­ ternal reforming catalyst layer for methane-fueled SOFCs to solve the degradation of cell performance due to carbon deposition. The electrochemical performance and coking tolerance of two types of cells with and without the catalyst layer were systematically studied using methane and hydrogen as fuels. With the catalyst layer, the single cell using methane as fuel exhibits an improvement in peak power density by 24\%, increasing from 297 to 367 mW cm− 2 and there was no diffusion barrier for fuel gases within the cell. Furthermore, the cell can stably run for 100 h in methane at 700 ◦C. The improvement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ni and Ru sites anchored on the porous Mo2C nanorods catalyst based on strong metalsupport interactions, promoting the effective catalytic conversion of CH4 to CO and H2. This study demon­ strates that the integration of a catalyst layer for internal reforming is an effective strategy for the direct use of methane in SOFCs.},

  abstract = {In the present study, an innovative method of fermentation osmotic activation was employed to produce acti­ vated carbon derived from rice husk. The fermentation procedure dismantles the robust lignin present on the rice husk surface, thereby liberating amorphous SiO2, enhances osmotic activation, and promotes pore development. Following the high-temperature osmosis treatment utilizing a KOH solution, a significant portion of the amor­ phous SiO2 on the husk’s surface is successfully dissolved and removed, leading to the formation of numerous carbon skeletons. This procedure culminates in the production of activated carbon characterized by a high specific surface area and substantial pore volume, attributed to the role of K ions during carbonization. The sample DFRO1-AC exhibited the most effective hydrogen gravimetric storage capacity of 1.21 wt\% at room temperature (25 ◦C) and 80 bar pressure, featuring a BET specific surface area of 2270 m2/g. Compared to other activated carbons used for hydrogen storage, our materials demonstrate superior hydrogen storage capacity and employ renewable agricultural waste, indicating high feasibility and broad application prospects.},

  abstract = {Direct ethanol fuel cell can convert chemical energy into electric energy directly, and has the advantages of being free from Carnot cycle and being friendly to environment, so it has a broad application prospect. However, the insufficient activity and toxicity resistance of anodic catalysts limit their commercial application, mainly due to the limited adsorption sites and the toxic inactivation of catalysts resulting from the production of toxic in­ termediates (COads) during the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) process. In this study, the Au@PdAg porous hemispherical catalyst assembled by nanotubes was successfully prepared by soft template method and coreduction method using dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DODAC) as surfactant, and its EOR perfor­ mance was tested. Au@Pd1.0Ag1.0 has the highest mass current density with a peak value of 4048.8 mA mg−Pd1, which is 7.8 times of Pd/C (JM). After 5000 s stability test, the residual current density value is still 863.4 mA mg−Pd1. The results showed that the introduction of the oxygenophilic metal Ag was conducive to the for­ mation of OHads and the oxidation of COads. The porous structure of the nanotube assembly facilitates electron transfer and provides more adsorption sites, which makes the catalyst show good electrocatalytic activity and anti-CO poisoning ability.},

This study experimentally evaluates the effect of the new serpentine flow field with sub-channel and by-pass (SFFSB) on the single cell performance and compares it with a conventional advanced serpentine flow field (CASFF). The maximum current and the power densities of the SFFSB are increased by 18.85\% and 23.74\%, respectively, due to the promotion of under-rib convection.},

It is recorded for various operating conditions (current density, gas stoichiometry, air inlet relative humidity, temperature, pressure) in a fuel cell stack fed by dry hydrogen. The measurement of the water transport coefficient shows that a significant fraction of water is collected at the anode while water is produced or injected at the cathode. Moreover, in usual operating conditions, liquid water is present at the cell outlet not only in the cathode but also in the anode. Contrary to the electrical performances, ageing has no influence on the water transport coefficient, which allows the comparison between data collected at different periods of the fuel cell lifetime. From this comparison, it was found that the hydrogen flow rate, the amount of vapor injected at cathode inlet, and the temperature are the main parameters influencing the water transport coefficient. It is shown that air and hydrogen stoichiometry present significant effects on water transport but only through these parameters.},

  abstract = {In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-\$K\$ out of \$N\$ experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into \$mN\$ ones and activating \$mK\$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating \$K\_s\$ experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40\% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5\% (maybe even 18.2\%) of computations.},

Major water transport mechanisms in the membrane and porous layers of MEA are summarized and the strategies to balance water in these components are also discussed. However, the experimental water transport data for different components under varied operating conditions are still insufficient and the understanding of transport mechanisms is still limited. To obtain better water management in PEMFCs, the design of the key components requires refinements. For future investigations more attention should be paid to the fundamental understanding and systematic data of water transport in each component of the MEA under varied operating conditions.},

The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the WikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well as competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces the latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a recurrent baseline.

Guided by the scaling laws, we introduce DeepSeek LLM, a project dedicated to advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective. To support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2 trillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the creation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM 67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B on various benchmarks, particularly in the domains of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that DeepSeek LLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5.},

  abstract = {The conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be ideally replaced by the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to achieve efficient hydrogen generation due to the superior thermodynamics. However, the UOR involves a slow 6-electron transfer dynamic, necessitating the utilization of high-performance catalysts to enhance cat­ alytic efficiency. In this work, a bifunctional transition metal-based catalysts, namely, MoO2–NiO/NF hetero­ structure, is effectively synthesized using two-step hydrothermal methods and calcination. Benefiting from the heterogeneous interface, the nanoflower-like structure as well as the electron density redistribution, the MoO2–NiO/NF catalyst demonstrates remarkable durability and performance, with an overpotential of 139 mV to achieve 10 mA cm− 2 for UOR. In addition, the bifunctional catalyst is used in a two-electrode electrolyzer, where a current density of 10 mA cm− 2 is attained at a potential of 1.317 V, which is 261 mV smaller than that of the conventional water splitting system. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoO2–NiO/NF heterostructure exhibits a higher density cloud in the vicinity of the Fermi level, revealing that it has faster electron transfer and higher electrical conductivity. Besides, the Mo sites and Ni sites are favorable for adsorption of CO(NH2)2 and H2O, respectively, which might optimize the reaction intermediates adsorption/ desorption for UOR/HER, ultimately leading to the high electrocatalytic performance of MoO2–NiO/NF. This research opens a new window for the development of advanced heterojunction electrocatalysts assisted by urea electrocatalysis for cost-effective hydrogen production.},

  abstract = {A numerical study is conducted to investigate supercritical hydrogen flow and heat transfer mechanisms and characteristics in printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) channels. The impact of large variations of the thermalphysical properties due to a wide range of operating temperatures have been studied and analyzed in detail. The heat transfer mechanisms of supercritical hydrgen under horizontal and vertical flow conditions are studied numerically. In addition, the influence of different cross-section shapes of the channel is also analyzed. The results show that asymmetrical fluid temperature distributions near the top wall and bottom wall due to the buoyancy effect result in heat transfer deterioration. Spiral flow occurs in the heat transfer deterioration region, which further confirms that the heat transfer deterioration is related to the spiral flow effect caused by the buoyancy effect. The heat transfer coefficient without gravity is lower than that with gravity, indicating that the buoyancy effect enhances the overall heat transfer in the horizontal circular channel. Furthermore, the fluid temperature in the vertical upflow channel decreases slowly from the near wall to the core area, while the fluid temperature in the vertical downflow channel changes sharply, which directly leads to the difference in the temperature gradient near the wall. Compared with the square cross-section channel and semicircular crosssection channel, the supercritical hydrogen can achieve greater heat transfer performance in the circular cross-section channel.},

Simulations predict cycles with pressure out of the experimental range in some cases, especially under high knock intensity, with observable developing detonation. The Han and Reitz model is found to be the most suitable model for simulating knocking conditions, considering its performance and simplicity. This model is then used to investigate the wall heat transfer mechanism under knocking conditions. The results show that thermal boundary layers within the cylinder are disturbed through different mechanisms, contributing to auto-ignition close to the knockmeter cavity. The interaction between auto-ignition-induced pressure oscillations and the thermal boundary layer significantly increases the heat transfer rate during end-gas auto-ignition.},

  abstract = {To address the pressing need for sustainable energy solutions, hydrogen has emerged as a “zero-emission” energy source with vast potential in diverse sectors like manufacturing, transportation, and electricity generation. However, the realization of a hydrogen economy hinges on the development of safe and stable technologies and materials for hydrogen storage and transport. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest ad­ vancements in hydrogen storage systems, with a particular focus on porous materials. Notably, porous carbon materials derived from biomass waste have garnered attention due to their exceptional qualities. These include abundant and easily accessible raw materials, simplified production processes, adjustable characteristics, costeffectiveness, low mass density, high specific surface area and porosity, structural diversity, and sustainable regeneration. These attributes position them as promising candidates for further exploration in hydrogen storage devices, particularly for achieving high H2 uptake capacities. The feasibility of utilizing both plant- and animalbased biomass porous carbons is examined, encompassing activated porous carbons, heteroatom doped porous carbons, and their composites, as pivotal components for the development of porous carbon storage devices. The synthesis and characterization of each form, along with their respective hydrogen storage capacities, are high­ lighted. While each material exhibits promise, it is important to note that they do present certain technological drawbacks. Addressing these limitations through further research and development is crucial to unlocking their full potential for future applications in the burgeoning hydrogen economy.},

Hydrogen liquefaction allows for a substantial increase in volumetric energy density; the required conversion of ortho-hydrogen (o-H2) to para-hydrogen (p-H2) is however one of several challenges. This conversion requires a catalyst for sufficiently rapid kinetics, however available conversion data is sparse. To this end, a high throughput ortho-hydrogen (o-H2) to para-hydrogen (pH2) conversion apparatus is detailed. This enables measurements at a controlled temperature of 77 K via the use of in-situ Raman Spectroscopy for quantitative determination of the ortho-para composition. Conversion kinetic data were acquired for a hydrous ferric oxide catalyst. These data were in reasonable agreement with limited existing literature, thus providing some validation for the use of conversion kinetic models, derived from such data, in hydrogen liquefaction design. Kinetic data was acquired using hydrogen provided via electrolysis; the effect of impurity (H2O) carry-over on conversion kinetics is considered.},

  abstract = {Developing highly active metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), as a thriving topic in overall water-splitting, can maximum atom utilization efficiency and yet entail high activity, and bifunctional hydrogen evolution re­ action (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts can enable more efficient overall water-splitting meanwhile reducing the cost than two individual unifunctional electrocatalysts. Bifunctional HER/OER SACs are thus of enormous economic importance and scientific interest. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a design of the optimal bifunctional SACs was achieved, namely, C30N12Se6H12 supported Rh (Rh@CNSeH). Also worth noting is that Rh@CNSeH stands out among 23 candidates and holds the promise of as an efficient bifunctional catalyst due to low HER/OER overpotential of 0.003/0.39 V, outperforming the com­ mercial Pt (0.09 V)/IrO2 (0.55 V) and achieving the overall water-splitting. Good stability demonstrated by calculations of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, antioxidant capacity and Pourbaix diagram ensured the implementation of Rh@CNSeH in ambient conditions. Remarkably, ΔGOH∗ can act as an energy descriptor to reveal and even predict the OER activity trend, whose changing trend can be quantitatively described by charge transfer descriptor (Bader charge analysis) and electronic structure descriptors (d-band center and integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP)). Moreover, an intrinsic descriptor (φ) coupled with the electro­ negativity and the d-electrons number of transition-metal can give a reasonable prediction and explanation for the catalytic activity origin. Finally, we built a bridge for structure-property relationship from intrinsic char­ acteristics to Bader charge, to d-band center, to ICOHP and then to free energies of intermediates, which can intuitively herald the activity origin of OER and give a reasonable guidance toward high-efficient designing for SACs.},

  abstract = {Liquid organic hydrogen carriers can store hydrogen for later release through dehydrogenation reactions. The kinetic rate depends on the temperature, pressure, and hydrogen concentration itself, so it varies throughout the discharge. As such, control systems are needed to meet the end-user power demand. An innovative plug flow reactor coupled with two vessels is introduced and accurately sized. Multiple strategies are implemented in a Matlab/Simulink model to test the efficacy of control methods based on pressure, temperature, and mass flow rate. The results obtained with the simulations highlight a dramatic drop in performance (utilisation factor lower than 80 \%) associated with relatively high power demands (higher than 70 \% in the case of temperature control), whereas low demands are met with satisfactory degrees of utilisation under both pressure and temperature control. Control over the mass flow rate of external fluid leads to lackluster results and should only be chosen as an auxiliary controlled variable. Lastly, Ragone diagrams for pressure and temperature control are presented and used to identify the optimal system sizing range: effective discharge duration should be in the range 10–40 h with pressure control or 5–40 h with temperature control to achieve a utilisation factor of at least 80 \%.},

Water and thermal management are intimately linked since evaporation is a potent source of cooling. This paper presents the basic design relationships that govern water and thermal balance in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell stacks and systems. Hydrogen/air and direct methanol fuel cells are both addressed and compared. Operating conditions for simultaneous water and thermal balance can be specified based on the cell’s electrochemical performance and the operating environment. These conditions can be used to specify the overall size and complexity of the cooling equipment. The water balance properties can have strong effects on the size of the thermal management equipment required.},

This study focuses on the evaluation of the dynamic performance and behaviour (purge cycle) of the commercial Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack towards water transport (water balance) at different operating conditions. The stack was operated at different current loads (0–10~A) and operating temperature (ambient to 50~°C). The results indicated that the measured water accumulation in the stack increased with the increase in current load. The optimal current load was 4~A, with calculated efficiency of 62.8\%. The optimal operating temperature was 40~°C, resulting in calculated efficiency of 52.3\%. At higher temperature, the fuel cell performance decreased, and the measured water balance was not properly distributed, which could be due to the dehydration and low conductivity of the electrolyte membrane. It can be concluded that the behaviour and performance of the stack, as well as the water balance in the stack, were influenced by the operating conditions. Moreover, this study improves the understanding of fuel cell performance and behaviour based on evaluation of the water balance.},

The membrane thickness, water management system, air management system and gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were examined to find their effects on the water balance coefficient, fuel utilization efficiency, energy efficiency and power density. Two membranes were used, Nafion® 112 and Nafion® 117. Nafion® 117 cells had greater water balance coefficients, higher fuel utilization efficiency and greater energy efficiency. A passive water management system which utilizes additional cathode gas diffusion layers (GDL) and a passive air management system which makes use of air filters was developed and tested. Water management was improved with the addition of two additional cathode GDLs. The water balance coefficients were increased from −1.930 to 1.021 for a cell using a 3.0molkg−1 solution at a current density of 33mAcm−2. The addition of an air filter further increased the water balance coefficient to 1.131. Maximum power density was improved from 20mWcm−2 to 25mWcm−2 for 3.0molkg−1 solutions by upgrading from second to third generation GDEs, obtained from E-TEK. There was no significant difference in water management found between second and third generation GDEs. A fuel utilization efficiency of 63\% and energy efficiency of 16\% was achieved for a 3.0molkg−1 solution with a current density of 66mAcm−2 for third generation GDEs.},

  abstract = {At present, despite the great advances in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology over the past two decades through intensive research and development activities, their large-scale commercialization is still hampered by their higher materials cost and lower reliability and durability. In this review, water management is given special consideration. Water management is of vital importance to achieve maximum performance and durability from PEMFCs. On the one hand, to maintain good proton conductivity, the relative humidity of inlet gases is typically held at a large value to ensure that the membrane remains fully hydrated. On the other hand, the pores of the catalyst layer (CL) and the gas diffusion layer (GDL) are frequently flooded by excessive liquid water, resulting in a higher mass transport resistance. Thus, a subtle equilibrium has to be maintained between membrane drying and liquid water flooding to prevent fuel cell degradation and guarantee a high performance level, which is the essential problem of water management. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art studies of water management, including the experimental methods and modeling and simulation for the characterization of water management and the water management strategies. As one important aspect of water management, water flooding has been extensively studied during the last two decades. Herein, the causes, detection, effects on cell performance and mitigation strategies of water flooding are overviewed in detail. In the end of the paper the emphasis is given to: (i) the delicate equilibrium of membrane drying vs. water flooding in water management; (ii) determining which phenomenon is principally responsible for the deterioration of the PEMFC performance, the flooding of the porous electrode or the gas channels in the bipolar plate, and (iii) what measures should be taken to prevent water flooding from happening in PEMFCs.},

  abstract = {In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HTPEMFCs), many types of resistance existed, but they have not been distinctly characterized in previous research. In this study, the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) methodology is employed, in conjunction with a homebuilt electrochemical electrode analysis system (EEAS), to figure out the specific resistance components in the cathode gas diffusion electrode (GDE). The impedance analysis by the DRT method was conducted using the electrochemical impedance spectrum obtained at different temperatures and current densities of the cathode only, isolated from the MEA environment. The four peaks (designated as Peak 0 to 3) were depicted at DRT plots of cathode GDE below 103 Hz. By comparing the DRT plots for different conditions and considering the EEAS structure, the four peaks were explained to be caused by distinct resistances occurring at the electrode and interface. The regions of each peak were distinguished according to their position changes with temperature and current density. Furthermore, by contrasting the DRT plots of the cathode GDE with those of MEA containing the same cathode, an additional peak (referred to as Peak 4) is identified between 103 Hz and 104 Hz, which was attributed to resistance originating from the anode. This study could provide a new approach for future research of new catalysts and electrodes utilizing the resistance analysis of MEA for HT-PEMFC.},

  abstract = {In air-breathing proton exchange membrane fuel cells (Air PEM FCs), a high rate of water evaporation from the cathode might influence the resistance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is highly dependent on the water content of the Nafion membrane. We propose a dead-end hydrogen anode as a means of intermediate storage of water/humidity for self-humidification of the membrane. Such an inflatable bag integrated with a single lightweight MEA FC has the potential in blimp applications for anode self-humidification. A dynamic numerical water balance model, validated by experimental measurements, is derived to predict the effect of MEA configuration, and the membrane’s hydration state and water transfer rate at the anode on MEA resistance and performance. The experimental setup included humidity measurements, and polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests to quantify the effect of membrane hydration on its resistance in a lightweight MEA (12 g) integrated with an inflatable dead-end hydrogen storage bag. Varying current densities (5, 10, and 15 mA/cm2) and cathode humidity levels (20, 50, and 80\%) were examined and compared with the numerical results. The validated model predicts that the hydration state of the membrane and water transfer rate at the anode can be increased by using a thin membrane and thicker gas diffusion layer.},

  abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells require good hydration in order to deliver high performance and ensure long life operation. Water is essential for proton conductivity in the membrane which increases by nearly six orders of magnitude from dry to fully hydrated. Adequate water management in PEM fuel cell is crucial in order to avoid an imbalance between water production and water removal from the fuel cell. In the present study, a novel mathematical zero-dimensional model has been formulated for the water mass balance and hydration of a polymer electrolyte membrane. This model incorporates all the essential fundamental physical and electrochemical processes occurring in the membrane electrolyte and considers the water adsorption/desorption phenomena in the membrane. The effect of diffusivity model, surface roughness and water content driving force is considered. The model is validated against experimental data. In the results it is shown that the fuel cell water balance calculated by this model shows better fit with experimental data-points compared with model where only steady state operation were considered. We conclude that this discrepancy is due a different rate of water transport when membrane absorption/desorption is considered in the model. The model becomes useful in system modeling when studying fuel cells in dynamic conditions.},

  abstract = {Thermal management has been considered as one of the most important issues for the operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Phase change affects the performance and even the heat balance of the stack during operation. A 46 single cell PEM stack with anode and cathode humidification is developed to investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect of phase change on the heat generation and removal characteristics of the stack. The results show that the heat removed by the coolant water is greater than that generated by the electrochemistry reaction, and heat released due to the phase change of water vapor cannot be neglected. Heat generated in the stack can be removed completely by the coolant water, which need to be forced cooling for recycling use when the current density reaches 1000 mA·cm−2. The arithmetic product of the specific heat capacity and mass of the stack can be used as a novel criterion to evaluate the validity of the heat balance in the system. The exothermic reaction is very fast in the stack, which consequently requires bipolar plates with high heat conductivity coefficient to improve the temperature uniformity at the elevated operational current density.

  abstract = {Low carrier separation efficiency and slow surface reaction kinetics are the main factors for restricting the development of photocatalytic technology. Construction of double Z-scheme heterojunction and deposition of cocatalyst on semiconductor are considered to be effective strategies to solve these problems. However, it is challenging to integrate dual Z-scheme heterojunction and cocatalyst in one system to enhance photocatalytic activity. In our paper, a novel ternary heterostructure TiO2/g-C3N4/NiCoP (TCNNCP) photocatalyst was con­ structed by depositing NiCoP cocatalyst on three-dimensional spherical TiO2/g-C3N4 surface. NiCoP in the composite can not only promote the surface reaction kinetics by reducing overpotential as a cocatalyst, but also improve the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency by constructing double Z-scheme heterojunctions with TiO2 and g-C3N4 as semiconductors. As a result, the optimized TCNNCP-2 composite exhibited a significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 2305.5 μmol g− 1, which was 20.21 times higher than that of pure TiO2 and 3.10 times higher than that of binary TiO2/g-C3N4 composite. Additionally, TCNNCP-2 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with an 86.2\% removal rate for Cr(VI) within 2 h. These outstanding results can be attributed to the synergistic effect achieved through the construction of double Zscheme heterojunctions and loading NiCoP cocatalyst, which enhance light-harvesting capability, carrier sepa­ ration and transmission efficiency while promoting surface photocatalytic reactions. This research will contribute to the development of more bifunctional noble metal-free cocatalysts for efficient photocatalysis.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a high solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion are in high demand due to the escalating energy crisis and environmental degradation. The STH efficiency is strongly correlated with the charge carrier separation, which can be improved by the inside electric dipole. Herein, the water-splitting capabilities of single-layer (SL) GaInS3 are explored by employing first-principles calculations. Theoretical outcomes reveal that SL GaInS3 exhibits a large intrinsic electric dipole and has a thermally stable structure at 300 K. SL GaInS3 displays a direct bandgap of 1.83 eV, as well as suitable band edges and abundant visible absorption (105 cm− 1) for solar-driven water-splitting. The electronic structure and carrier mobility calculations demonstrate the high separation efficiency of charge carriers, which is strongly affirmed by the quite long carrier lifetime of 8.26 ns. The overpotential analysis of charge carriers suggests that the oxygen generation of SL GaInS3 can be accom­ plished without a cocatalyst, while hydrogen generation can be completed with the aid of cocatalysts. The STH efficiency of SL GaInS3 reaches up to 16.8\%, apparently surpassing the commercial standard (10\%). In brief, the high STH and long carrier lifetime promise the possible application of SL GaInS3 for solar water splitting. What’s more, this work provides straight evidence that 2D photocatalysts with inside dipoles exhibit a long carrier lifetime.},

  abstract = {We present DeepSeek-VL, an open-source Vision-Language (VL) Model designed for real-world vision and language understanding applications. Our approach is structured around three key dimensions: We strive to ensure our data is diverse, scalable, and extensively covers real-world scenarios including web screenshots, PDFs, OCR, charts, and knowledge-based content, aiming for a comprehensive representation of practical contexts. Further, we create a use case taxonomy from real user scenarios and construct an instruction tuning dataset accordingly. The fine-tuning with this dataset substantially improves the model's user experience in practical applications. Considering efficiency and the demands of most real-world scenarios, DeepSeek-VL incorporates a hybrid vision encoder that efficiently processes high-resolution images (1024 x 1024), while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead. This design choice ensures the model's ability to capture critical semantic and detailed information across various visual tasks. We posit that a proficient Vision-Language Model should, foremost, possess strong language abilities. To ensure the preservation of LLM capabilities during pretraining, we investigate an effective VL pretraining strategy by integrating LLM training from the beginning and carefully managing the competitive dynamics observed between vision and language modalities. The DeepSeek-VL family (both 1.3B and 7B models) showcases superior user experiences as a vision-language chatbot in real-world applications, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of visual-language benchmarks at the same model size while maintaining robust performance on language-centric benchmarks. We have made both 1.3B and 7B models publicly accessible to foster innovations based on this foundation model.},

  abstract = {Water balance in a free-breathing polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell was studied, focusing on the effect of anode conditions. The methods used were current distribution measurement, water collection from the anode outlet, and the measurement of cell polarization and resistance. Current density levels were 100 and 200 mA cm−2, temperature levels were 40 and 60 °C, and hydrogen stoichiometry range was from 1.5 to 2.5. The direction of hydrogen flow was varied. The fraction of product water exiting through the anode outlet varied from 0 to 58\%, and it was found to increase with increasing temperature and hydrogen flow rate. When the general direction of hydrogen flow was against the direction of air flow, the percentage of water removal through the anode was smaller and the current distributions were more even than in the cases where the direction was the same as that of the air flow. This probably resulted from a more favorable distribution of water over the active area. The results also indicate that the net water transport coefficient varies across the active area. In further measurements, operation with the anode side in dead-end mode was investigated. It was also found that water distribution was more favorable when the general direction of hydrogen flow was against the air flow.},

  abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) in distribution systems can enhance operating conditions by reducing losses and improving voltage indices. This paper introduces a dual-stage risk-based framework that concurrently tackles day-ahead reconfiguration and microgrid scheduling within the distribution network. To control the negative aspects of uncertainties, the proposed framework integrates energy storage systems (ESS/HSS) and demand response programs (DRPs) at the network level, enhancing adaptability. The initial stage of the proposed model employs the AC power flow model, utilizing loss and voltage deviation functions as objective benchmarks for network reconfiguration. The scheduling is meticulously executed per interval, deriving optimized structures under diverse scenarios with the aid of a case reduction technique (CRT) to streamline solutions. The ultimate solution employs the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and CPLEX solver in the first and second stages respectively. Outcomes from applying this approach to the adjusted 118-bus network manifest improved oper­ ational conditions and voltage quality through reconfiguration. Impressively, the integration of ESS/HSS and DRPs yields a substantial 22.34\% reduction in total operating costs, a conclusion substantiated by the numerical findings. Furthermore, by leveraging the CRT, a remarkable 56.17\% reduction in problem-solution time is achieved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a one-dimensional transport model for water transport across Nafion® membranes in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. This physics-based model is based on the three main water transport mechanisms: diffusion, electro-osmotic drag, and pressure-driven flow. A good agreement is obtained between the model predictions using the measured values of the physical parameters as inputs and the previously reported experimental data. Further, with the help of this simple transport model, the numerical analysis is performed to delineate the effect of electrolyzer operating conditions on the net water transport across the membrane, water condensation at the cathode, individual contribution of the transport fluxes, and electrolyzer design. Finally, the model is exercised to simulate the dependence of water transport as a function of membrane thickness. This confirms the validity of the current approach of using thin reinforced membranes by electrolyzer fabricators.},

  abstract = {The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process transforms heavy wastes into lighter, more valuable (naphtha, light olefins and gases) products. However, the unit’s byproducts contain a large quantity of CO2, which contributes to global warming. As a result, the purpose of this research was to increase the production of valuable products such as light olefins, naphtha, and hydrogen while reducing environmental impacts using the water gas shift reaction, with sensitivity analysis for three parameters (riser height, FCC feed temperature, and inlet naphtha mass flow). As a result of increasing the riser height, the output of light olefins (45\%) and gases (32\%) increased. Furthermore, the amount of hydrogen produced increases with a decrease in riser height (about 6\%) and an increase in inlet naphtha mass flow (about 8\%). Energy and exergy assessments were also carried out. It was determined that FCC had the lowest exergy destruction with a contribution of 23 MW when compared to its energy usage of 172 MW. The cooler, on the other hand, was one of the process’s most energy-consuming (25\%) and damaging (26\%). As a result, this technique can lessen environmental effects by absorbing 125 tons of CO2 every hour and producing 3484 kg/h of hydrogen. Economic evaluations were also undertaken, and the results revealed that the cooler has the lowest exergoeconomic factor (1\%) while the FCC unit contributes the most (95\%). The fractionator column is also the most expensive device in the whole process.},

The effec­ tive and controlled doping of Cu to NiCo2O4 lattice by the partial replacement of Ni2+/Ni3+ with Cu+/Cu2+ results in the fine-tuning of structural, morphological, and electronic characteristics, favourable for electro­ catalytic HER. The study effectively correlates the influence of variation in the percentages of Cu-doping on the material properties and thereby the electrocatalytic characteristics. The experimental results indicate that Cu0.10Ni0.90Co2O4 electrode having optimum Cu-doping (10\%) as the best electrocatalyst with the lowest onset potential for hydrogen evolution (242.7 mV) and reduced overpotential (72.5 mV) values by following a Volmer – Heyrovsky mechanism during HER. The improvement in HER performance after Cu-doping is due to the generation of greater number of active sites and reduction in electronic band gap. The present work advanta­ geously utilises the scope of microwave-assisted transition metal doping strategy to fine tune the physico­ chemical and electronic characteristics, favourable for electrocatalytic HER, and this may pave a new way for tuning the electrochemical properties of metal oxides for various applications.},

The water balance is directly analyzed by measuring the weight of the adherent water wiped away from each the component. As a result, we find that hydrophobic treatment without MPL leads to the increase in liquid water accumulation at the electrode which limits the oxygen transport to the catalyst and then lowers the cell voltage rapidly during start-up, whereas the treatment decreases the water at the GDL. The water accumulation at the electrode also decreases the cumulative current that represents the power generation and calorific power indispensable for warming up at a temperature below freezing point. On the other hand, we directly find that the hydrophobic treatment with MPL addition suppresses the water accumulation at the electrode, which increases the cumulative current. In addition, it is found that increase in air permeability of a GDL substrate by its coarser structure increases the cumulative current, which is explained by enhancing the exhaust of the product water vapor and liquid as well as by enhancing the oxygen transport directly. Thus, the hydrophobic treatment with MPL addition and larger air permeability of a GDL substrate improve the start-up performance of a PEFC.},

Therefore, it is critically important to understand the two-phase flow of liquid water combined with either the hydrogen (anode) or air (cathode) streams. In this paper, we describe the design of an in situ test apparatus that enables investigation of two-phase channel flow within PEMFCs, including the flow of water from the porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) into the channel gas flows; the flow of water within the bipolar plate channels themselves; and the dynamics of flow through multiple channels connected to common manifolds which maintain a uniform pressure differential across all possible flow paths. These two-phase flow effects have been studied at relatively low operating temperatures under steady-state conditions and during transient air purging sequences.},

  abstract = {Integrating PEM fuel cells effectively with liquid hydrocarbon reforming requires careful system analysis to assess trade-offs associated with H2 production, purification, and overall water balance. To this end, a model of a PEM fuel cell system integrated with an autothermal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon fuels (modeled as C12H23) and with H2 purification in a water–gas-shift/membrane reactor is developed to do iterative calculations for mass, species, and energy balances at a component and system level. The model evaluates system efficiency with parasitic loads (from compressors, pumps, and cooling fans), system water balance, and component operating temperatures/pressures. Model results for a 5-kW fuel cell generator show that with state-of-the-art PEM fuel cell polarization curves, thermal efficiencies {$>$}30\% can be achieved when power densities are low enough for operating voltages {$>$}0.72V per cell. Efficiency can be increased by operating the reformer at steam-to-carbon ratios as high as constraints related to stable reactor temperatures allow. Decreasing ambient temperature improves system water balance and increases efficiency through parasitic load reduction.

  abstract = {Integrating PEM fuel cells effectively with liquid hydrocarbon reforming requires careful system analysis to assess trade-offs associated with H2 production, purification, and overall water balance. To this end, a model of a PEM fuel cell system integrated with an autothermal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon fuels (modeled as C12H23) and with H2 purification in a water–gas-shift/membrane reactor is developed to do iterative calculations for mass, species, and energy balances at a component and system level. The model evaluates system efficiency with parasitic loads (from compressors, pumps, and cooling fans), system water balance, and component operating temperatures/pressures. Model results for a 5-kW fuel cell generator show that with state-of-the-art PEM fuel cell polarization curves, thermal efficiencies {$>$}30\% can be achieved when power densities are low enough for operating voltages {$>$}0.72V per cell. Efficiency can be increased by operating the reformer at steam-to-carbon ratios as high as constraints related to stable reactor temperatures allow. Decreasing ambient temperature improves system water balance and increases efficiency through parasitic load reduction. The baseline configuration studied herein sustained water balance for ambient temperatures ≤35°C at full power and ≤44°C at half power with efficiencies approaching ∼27 and ∼30\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Anode reversal is a detrimental phenomenon that occurs in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) when the anode is subject to fuel starvation, leading to irreversible damage. This is a critical issue for the commercialization of PEMFCs. However, the development of more robust anode catalysts has been limited by the need for membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-level testing, which is costly and time-consuming. Here, we propose two accelerated stress test (AST) protocols based on widely available rotating disc electrode (RDE) methods to determine their suitability for screening anode catalysts and predicting MEA-level durability. One method is based on a carbon corrosion (cc) voltage cycling protocol between 1.0 and 1.5 V vs. RHE, while the other is a chronopotentiometry (cp) method. We evaluate three model catalysts (Pt30, Pt50, and Pt70) at the MEA-level through standard reversal testing and at the RDE-level using the two AST protocols (RDE-cc and RDEcp). We find that both RDE-level methods can reliably predict MEA-level anode durability, and can be used by materials scientists to screen the relative durability of new anode catalysts. Our results also suggest Pt70 is a promising candidate for anode reversal tolerant PEMFCs, as it shows superior durability under both MEA-level and RDE-level tests.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen exploration in the municipality of Marica´ (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil) indicates that important hydrogen and helium gas fluxes are emitted through reactivated faults. The gas concentrations in the soils, and the modelled gas fluxes, are among the most intense measured so far in the world. This exploration has shown new surface expression of hydrogen micro-seeps, observed along reactivated large tectonic accidents instead of “fairy circles”, most common proxy for hydrogen systems in cratonic formation. The geology of Marica´, con­ sisting in Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks without any already documented evidence of hydrogen-prone formations, appears as a very new field of investigation for natural hydrogen. Results indicate the presence of systematic hydrogen saturation of the usual detectors plugged at 80 cm depth, as well as a permanent recharge of hydrogen through time, without relaxation time. Moreover, positive helium anomalies are associated with this hydrogen soil gas, proving the existence of a gas flux coming from deep horizons of the subsurface. This reduces the risk of misinterpretation of surface hydrogen measurement, since the fear of drill bit metamorphism or su­ perficial biological activity inducing hydrogen artefacts is always a possibility. These hydrogen and helium micro-seeps are associated with positive thorium concentration superficial anomalies, as it was already observed in other places associated with hydrogen exudations. We present a model of soil gas behavior, with a differential process of adsorption/desorption of each gas compound (N2, O2, Ne, H2 and He), associated with a deep flux of hydrogen and helium. It is possible to assess a quantification of hydrogen flux of 0.32 m3 m− 2.day− 1. The surface flux ratio He/H2 is much higher than any published value of generative flux. This may be explained by a sub­ surface accumulation, where hydrogen is severely altered whereas helium is preserved, increasing the relative proportion of helium versus hydrogen.},

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (\textasciitilde 65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

The proper management of water flow within the fuel cell is essential to a successful operation of such systems. In this research, a mathematical model is developed for an alkaline fuel cell that identifies operating conditions resulting in a water balance. The model is one-dimensional and is derived from basic principles of gas-phase transport phenomena. With the aid of this model, one may determine an optimal set of values for current density, gas-stream flow rates and humidities, temperature, and pressure which assure the cell will not operate with a water deficit or surplus. Furthermore, expressions for the concentration profiles in the gas-diffusion layers can be obtained. Ultimately, this analysis provides an estimate of the limiting current density based on the oxidant transport.},

Addressing the imperative for clean energy in our industrialized era, copper oxide emerges as a viable electrocatalyst for hydrogen production through water splitting, offering an eco-friendly alternative to precious metals. Electrolytic water splitting using copper oxide proves highly efficient, ensuring rapid and uncontami­ nated hydrogen production. Researchers globally are actively pursuing economically viable implementations of this process. This study exclusively focuses on CuO-based nanostructures, exploring their role as efficient elec­ trocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It investigates various environmentally friendly synthesis methods and analyzes the crystal structure of copper oxide under different parameters. Assessing CuO-based catalyst activity in OER and HER under diverse conditions, the study provides a comprehensive overview of their electrocatalytic performance in water splitting. Integrating this knowledge with catalyst developments holds promise for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. The study concludes by discussing future research aspects and pinpointing gaps to guide the development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts.},

Herein, we synthesized a direct S-scheme Zn0.5Cd0.5S/MoS2 composite by employing facile in-situ hydrothermal method for drug degradation and H2 generation coupled with benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation. Further, the structural, morphological, compositional, and thermal properties of as-synthesized material were all thoroughly studied. The experimental results revealed that Zn0.5Cd0.5S/10\%MoS2 (ZCMS-10) composite exhibited 92.54\% degradation efficiency for KTC drug within 150 min under natural solar light. Furthermore, throughout five cycles, this study showed outstanding recy­ clability. Additionally, as-synthesized material demonstrated remarkable H2 generation coupled with oxidation of BA into benzaldehyde (BAL). The H2 generation rate was found to be 2.3470 mmolg− 1h− 1 and conversion 38.52\% of BA with the selectivity of 95.48\% for BAL. The enhanced photocatalytic performance might be attributed to the effective charge transfer between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and MoS2, facilitated by the direct S-scheme mechanism. Based on the findings of radical trapping experiments, the charge transfer process over the photo­ catalyst was completely studied. This study provides insights into the development of effective photocatalysts for environmental remediation and generation of renewable energy.},

However, the key challenge with this method lies in the development of low-cost catalysts showing high-performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given the rapid advances in the structural design of HER catalysts, a potential procedure to boost their performance is introduced herein. A controllable interlayer stress is generated at the homojunction NiS/NiS interface of electrodeposited hybrid transition metal sulphide NiS/MoS2, by precisely regulating lattice mismatches of NiS nanostructures, achieve a precise control over its charge transfer resistance and the effective balance of electrochemical area. Accordingly, an optimal design, NM5030 (NiS(50 mA/cm2)-NiS(20 mA/cm2)/MoS2/CC), showing an excellent HER performance in alkaline electrolyte is produced. It can drive a high current density of 10 mA/cm2, 100 mA/cm2 and 400 mA/cm2 at a low overpotential of 18 mV, 93 mV and 161 mV, respectively. Under chronoamperometric test, no obvious reduction in current density is observed after 48 h, indicating its high stability. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy of fabricating lattice mismatch to find an optimal layered structure based catalyst for efficient HER.},

Also, three-dimensional electrochemical models have been used to predict the distributions of current, temperature, and species mole fractions as a function of the operating conditions and geometry of small cells and these predictions have been compared with experimental data. However, the commercial viability of PEMFC systems depends on understanding the mass transport and electrochemistry of large-scale electrodes with reacting area on the order of 200–600cm2 and numerical investigation of PEMFCs of this size have been effectively impossible without the recent advances in parallel computation and processor speed. This paper applies a parallelized three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to a 480cm2 PEMFC flow-field selected from US patent literature to demonstrate that analysis of large-scale cells is possible. The distributions of pressure, temperature, and electrochemical variables for stationary and automotive operating conditions are examined. Using parallel computing techniques, the computational time is shown to be significantly reduced by increasing the number of processors while maintaining less than 1\% error in mass balance.},

The model is then calibrated for a variety of accelerated stress test data with different upper and lower potential limits and temperatures. Next, a case study of fuel cell transit bus operation in the city of Victoria, B.C., Canada is carried out to investigate the effects of stack size and temperature on the cathode catalyst durability. To this end, the required power density and cell voltage are calculated from the drive cycle considering vehicle dynamics and specifications. Larger stacks are found to experience higher upper potential limits; thus, showing lower lifetimes. The cathode lifetime is predicted to grow 379\% at 80°C if the stack nominal power is lowered from 396 to 132~kW while the performance requirement is met. The temperature is also shown to have a tremendous impact on the cathode lifetime. A temperature drop from 80 to 60°C results in 154\% cathode lifetime enhancement for a stack nominal power of 264~kW.},

  abstract = {The human population is now through a process of evolution, whereby there is a gradual shift towards the adoption and utilization of alternative energy sources and technologies for energy storage. In this transition process non-availability of renewable energy sources round the clock is one of the key hurdles. It is possible to meet continuous energy demands by storing excess renewable energy as hydrogen. The presented experimental investigation focuses on a modified reversible fuel cell (MRFC) with a solid carbon-based substance (carbon nitride) integrated into it as a host for electrochemical hydrogen storage. The method for electrode fabrication from carbon nitride powder and PTFE binder and a lab-scaled MRFC is disclosed. The developed MRFC with an integrated hydrogen storage electrode is put through electrochemical testing, and the results are presented. Galvanostatic charging and discharging is done, and the results are examined to ascertain the electrode’s elec­ trochemical hydrogen storage capacity. The electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of the porous carbon nitride electrode is found to be 1.15 wt\%, which is comparable to intermetallic metal hydride-based hydrogen storage mediums viz. AB2 and AB5. The obtained results showed the feasibility of a MRFC with an integrated carbon nitride-based hydrogen storage electrode, making it the first device of its kind. Besides, porous carbon nitride is proved to be a potential candidate for reversible electrochemical hydrogen adsorption. This will contribute to the clean energy sector and surely a step forward toward hydrogen economy.},

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are a powerful tool to analyze the flow in Rotating Detonation Engines, but their implementation is not straightforward. Many groups use simplifications (perfect premixing, geometrical 2D representations of the chamber) and numerical high-fidelity analysis comparing mixing assumptions in full scale configurations are not commonly found in literature. In this work a 3D LES of a full RDE tested at TU Berlin is performed and the influence of mixing assumptions (fully premixed vs. non-premixed) and sub-grid scale models on the detonation propagation are investigated. Simulations show that premixed RDEs burn more fuel in a detonation regime, resulting in a faster detonation wave than in the non-premixed case, while a change in the sub-grid scale model does not lead to significant changes. LES reveals that all cases lose a high amount of fuel to non-detonative combustion. These results show, that mixing plays a significant role in the LES of RDEs and has to be included to increase the accuracy of the simulations. The importance of deflagration in the overall RDE combustor implies, that chemistry models need to account for deflagration properties as well as for detonation to capture the efficiency of RDEs.},

In this study, liquid water measurement obtained from neutron imaging tests is compared with numerical results. The model is able to predict qualitatively the presence of liquid water with a good accuracy taking into account the real Bipolar Plate (BP) design. Based on the reliability of the predictions at this first order in-plane space scale, the model has been used to compute the thickness of liquid water through the plane of the cell, in the different components of the stack, Gas Channel (GC) or Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE). Our two-phase flow formulation has also been compared to more classical phase-separated two-phase flow model. A good accordance is observed for low saturations. The good agreement between predictions and measurement results supports the capability of our model to be employed in predictive control strategies or to design innovative Bipolar Plate (BP) at lower cost compared to experimental tests.},

To guarantee a long life, water and thermal management has to be controlled in a careful way. To understand the water, alkali and thermal flows, a model for an alkaline fuel cell module is developed using a control volume approach. Special attention is given to the physical flow of hydrogen, water and air in the system and the diffusion laws are used to gain insight in the water management. The model is validated on the prediction of the electrical performance and thermal behaviour. The positive impact of temperature on fuel cell performance is shown. New in this model is the inclusion of the water management, for which an extra validation is performed. The model shows that a minimum temperature has to be reached to maintain the electrolyte concentration. Increasing temperature for better performance without reducing the electrolyte concentration is possible with humidified hot air.},

The performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and water balance of fuel cells with WTPs and solid plates were evaluated. Benefiting from the humidification and drainage functions of the WTP, the performance of fuel cells with WTPs significantly improved compared with fuel cells with traditional solid plates. As indicated from the experiments, a WTP that was placed on the cathode side is favorable for cell performance and system complexity. Additionally, hydrogen stoichiometry hardly affects the water transport, whereas a decrease in air stoichiometry can switch the main function of the WTP from humidification to water drainage.

Accurate liquid water modelling is inherently challenging due to the multi-phase, multi-component, reactive dynamics within multi-scale, multi-layered porous media. In addition, currently inadequate imaging and modelling capabilities are limiting simulations to small areas ({$<$}1\,mm               2               ) or simplified architectures. Herein, an advancement in water modelling is achieved using X-ray micro-computed tomography, deep learned super-resolution, multi-label segmentation, and direct multi-phase simulation. The resulting image is the most resolved domain (16\,mm               2               with 700\,nm voxel resolution) and the largest direct multi-phase flow simulation of a fuel cell.

  abstract = {Significant progress had been made in various fields with transition metal oxide electrode materials, particularly in battery materials where structural control played a crucial role in enhancing their electrochemical properties. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of a raspberry-like hierarchical core-shell structure derived from Co–Zn MOF as anode materials by varying concentration of reaction solution in hydrothermal method. The hierarchical raspberry-like hollow shell structure was beneficial to expose more active sites and reduced the diffusion distance of Li+ to the internal electroactive sites, improving the overall electrical con­ ductivity of the electrode by full contact with carbon. Carbon nanotubes were incorporated into more suitable core-shell structure. They were uniformly coated the hollow sphere and filled inside of that to form a carbon skeleton. Specifically, the carbon nanotubes inside of the hollow sphere supported the shell not to collapse. This mitigated volume expansion during the cycling process, maintains structure stability, and allowed for rear­ rangement to occur during cycling to achieve a high specific capacity. Furthermore, the carbon nanotubes inside and outside of the hollow sphere created a high-density interface that enhanced interfacial polarisation and accelerated the rate of Li+ passage during cycling. These effects had resulted in an improvement in the material’s performance. It is noteworthy that the specific capacity attains 1050 mAh g-1 when exposed to a current density of 0.2 A g-1. Notably, even after conducting 500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, the specific capacity remains stable at 652 mAh g-1.},

  abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with high energy-conversion efficiency and high fuel flexibility play crucial roles in the low-carbon hydrogen economy, being faced with two main difficulties of carbon deposition and sulfur poison in conventional Ni-based cermet anodes. Perovskite oxides stand out to be a new generation of high-performing anode materials due to their high mixed-ionic-electronic conductivity, efficient fuel-oxidation electrocatalytic activity, and growing carbon-coking/sulfur-poison resistance but still suffer from the structural and performing instability. In recent years, B-site doping is recognized as one of advanced strategies for achieving high-durability perovskite anodes of high-temperature SOFCs, which is rapidly developing. Here, we summary the effects of several common B-site doping elements (Cr, Sc, Ti, Nb, and Mo) on the performance of perovskite anodes, and review the B-site doping strategies for perovskite anodes of high-temperature SOFCs. A variety of elements are introduced to stabilize the perovskite structure in the fuel-cell operating environments after B-site doping, and the improvement and deficiency of these element doping on various aspects of anode performance are discussed. By symmetrically comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these element doping, we point out the developing directions of high-temperature fuel-cell perovskite anodes in the future.},

However, the design and synthesis of effective photocatalytic materials with excellent electron/hole separation efficiency, fast charge transfer, and low carrier recombination rate still face great challenge. Herein, hollow p-n heterojunction MoS2@ZnIn2S4 nanoboxes are synthesized for the first time by growing n-type ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) twodimensional nanosheets on the surface of p-type hollow MoS2 nanoboxes (MSNBs), which exhibits obvious photocatalytic activity. Among them, 5\% MSNBs@ZIS photocatalyst shows the highest hydrogen production efficiency of 22.25 mmol h-1 g-1, which is 7.3 times that of pure ZIS. The high photocatalytic hydrogen pro­ duction efficiency of 5\% MSNBs@ZIS can be attributed to the formation of hollow structure and p-n hetero­ junction, which can provide a large number of catalytic active sites, large surface area, and can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, respectively.},

  abstract = {Water balance in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was investigated by measurements of the net drag coefficient under various conditions. The effects of water balance in the PEMFC on the cell performance were also investigated at different operating conditions. Experimental results reveal that the net drag coefficient of water through the membrane depended on current density and humidification of feed gases. It was found that the net drag coefficient (net number of water molecules transported per proton) ranged from −0.02 to 0.93, and was dependent on the operating conditions, the current load and the level of humidification. It was also found that the humidity of both anode and cathode inlet gases had a significant effect on the fuel cell performance. The resistance of the working fuel cell showed that the membrane resistance increased as the feed gas relative humidity (RH) decreased. The diffusion of water across Nafion membranes was also investigated by experimental water flux measurements. The electro-osmotic drag coefficient was evaluated from the experimental results of water balance and diffusion water flux measurements. The value of electro-osmotic drag coefficient, ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 under various operating conditions, was in agreement with literature values. The electro-osmotic drag coefficient, the net flux of water through the membrane and the effective drag as a function of operating conditions will also provide validation data for the fuel cell modeling and simulation efforts.},

A water-flux model for vapor and liquid phases along a gas flow channel is developed. The dependency of the operating and design parameters, such as temperature, pressure, gas and liquid flow rate, and size of the fuel cell, on the water management along the flow channel is demonstrated. Issues associated with liquid water and membrane/electrode dry out as well as system water balance are identified. An “intracell” water-exchange method, which can remove or supply water within a cell depending on local demand, is described.

This article designs poly(aryl alkylene) AEMs with different aryl backbone chains (biphenyl, p-terphenyl and m-terphenyl), with the goal of examining the effect of spatial structure main chains on the membrane performance. It is found that the membrane (m-QTPNP) has a better microphase separation structure and a conductivity of 143.5 mS cm− 1 (80 ◦C) via SAXS, TEM and AFM. Due to the lower IEC (2.23 meq g− 1), m-QTPNP has a good anti-swelling performance. During tensile testing, the elongation at break of m-QTPNP can reach 105.5\% (wet state). Moreover, due to the obvious microphase separation, the attack of OH− on the quaternized groups is reduced, and m-QTPNP has a conductivity retention rate of 95.5\% (80 ◦C, 2 M NaOH, 1560 h). In addition, the peak power density (PPD) of the H2/O2 single cell equipped with m-QTPNP can reach 749 mW cm− 2 (80 ◦C). After 90 h of durability testing, the voltage decayed to 92.2\%, with a decay rate of 0.54 mV h− 1.},

In this study, a large-scale PEMFC (109.93\,cm2), which is a repeated unit in commercial stacks and includes realistic anode and cathode flow fields, is investigated in detail utilizing a comprehensive 3D multi-phase model. In particular, the Eulerian-Eulerian model is chosen for the solution of gas and liquid two-phase flow in flow fields and the surface tension, wall adhesion, drag force and gravity are all taken into consideration. The gas concentration and liquid water amount in each channel of flow field are studied to test the influence of flow field. Moreover, it is proved that increasing operating pressure is helpful to improve PEMFC performance by increasing the reactant gas concentration and membrane water content significantly. Besides, counter-flow arrangement of hydrogen and air facilitates uniform distribution of membrane content and electrochemical reaction. And in this case, the coolant flow direction designed to be the same with that of air is beneficial to PEMFC performance.},

Although the high OER activity of NiFe-LDH and HER activity of NiCu/NF, NiCu/FeNi2S4 heterostructures is demonstrated by the small overpotentials of HER/OER (306 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2), in com­ parison with NiCu/NF (315 mV) and NiCu/NiFe-LDH (357 mV).

The high-performance bifunctional catalytic effects can be attributed to the synergistic effects of reversible surface reconstruction in the presence of S element, enabling the formation of the NiO/Ni interface at the low potential for HER and high oxidation states (Ni2+δ) at the high potential for OER. The results provide insights into the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity.},

  abstract = {Poor water management usually leads to various degrees of flooding in the hydrogen type fuel cell, affecting both the instantaneous performance and the long-term durability of the system adversely. While a lot of fuel cell diagnostic tools exist that could be utilized for the flooding diagnostics, most of these approaches are intrusive, requiring special modification to the fuel cell that affects its integrity, or special equipment (e.g. AC spectrometer) that adds to the complexity and cost of the system, and therefore are not considered to be a viable solution for the on-board integration of the diagnostic scheme.This paper proposes a model based approach for the fuel cell flooding diagnostics problem, utilizing only the cell current and voltage, and the inlet pressures of the fuel cell as the input signals of the diagnostic scheme. A diagnostic-oriented fuel cell system dynamic model is developed to incorporate the effects of the fault, i.e. the flooding, on the system dynamics. For simplicity, only the cathode channel flooding, the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) flooding, and the anode channel flooding are considered while we neglect the mass transport loss through the anode GDL. The cathode channel flooding and the GDL flooding diagnostic problems are decoupled and formulated as standard joint state and parameter estimation problems, with the amounts of the liquid water treated as varying system parameters to be identified. The unscented Kalman Filter technique has been applied to solve these problems. Simulation results validate the applicability of the cascading unscented Kalman filter design for flooding diagnostics.},

  abstract = {The development of high activity, low-cost and stability hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is a core issue in the field of water splitting. Herein, the bimetallic CoMo MOFs-derived N-doped carbon nanospheres with Co/Mo–N bonds is proposed to effectively improve the electrocatalytic HER performance. Meanwhile, the combination of the porous and spherical structure further promotes the effective contact on the electrode/ electrolyte interface while enhancing the electrolyte into the inner structure of the material for a fast HER process. In addition, the N-doped and bimetallic Co/Mo oxides on the rough surface of nanospheres have the capability to furnish more electrocatalytic active sites. The obtained electrocatalyst owns the small overpotential of 112 mV at 10 mA cm− 2 and Tafel slope of 106.8 mV dec− 1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. This work provides a new prospect for the rational design and fabrication of bimetallic active sites in carbon nanomaterials electrocatalysts in the relevant energy applications.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the water balance issue is extremely important for improving the performance and durability of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. In the presented paper, the visualization platform of the single fuel cell and the water balance model were built to investigate the water transport mechanisms. A transparent 25\,cm2 single fuel cell with serpentine flow channels was adopted. Based on the experimental data, firstly, the change rate of water content in the fuel cell was calculated quantitatively and the reliability of the water balance model was rigorously validated. Then, the water state in the fuel cell as the qualitative finding was observed online to assist the research of water transport mechanisms. Finally, the effects of inlet gas temperature, inlet gas humidity, and hydrogen/air stoichiometry on the EIS, the voltage, and the water content in the fuel cell were studied quantitatively, respectively. The corresponding relationship between the performance and the water content in the fuel cell was obtained.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of hydrogen sorption properties in materials is crucial for their widespread applications. How­ ever, existing volumetric apparatuses often suffer from low accuracy and efficiency due to inadequate calibration techniques, temperature gradients, and limited automation. To address these limitations, a Temperature-Variable Cycle (TVC) Sieverts apparatus has been developed. Besides conventional tests, the device is capable of effi­ ciently performing TVC tests, such as TVC Pressure-Composition-Temperature (PCT) isotherm and kinetics, through the integration of RS485 serial communication and automatic dosing techniques. The instrument’s component selection and configuration were described in detail. Furthermore, novel methods for volume cali­ bration and anti-thermal gradient were presented, where a continuous function was proposed to overcome temperature gradients across the entire range of test temperatures. Finally, a series of tests were conducted using La0.5Ce0.5Ni4Co alloy and Mg material as benchmark materials to validate the setup and methods. The accuracy of volumes and the feasibility of the methods were confirmed through null PCT tests and data comparisons of PCT with kinetic of La0.5Ce0.5Ni4Co alloy, respectively. By employing these methods, the accuracy of null tests is improved by nearly tenfold. The efficiency and robustness of the unit were demonstrated through TemperatureProgrammed Desorption/Absorption (TPD/TPA), TVC PCT, and TVC kinetics tests on MgH2 powder. The results produced by the TVC system align well with the reliable data in literature.},
